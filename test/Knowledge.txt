### Mapper<Object, Text, IntWritable, IntWritable>
Object: This is the type of the input key. In this case, the input key is ignored, so it is specified as Object.

Text: This is the type of the input value. In this case, the input value is expected to be a Text object, which is a Hadoop-specific class that represents a sequence of characters.

Text: This is the type of the intermediate key. The mapper processes the input data and generates a set of intermediate key-value pairs, where the key is of type Text.

IntWritable: This is the type of the intermediate value. The mapper processes the input data and generates a set of intermediate key-value pairs, where the value is an integer represented by an IntWritable object, which is a Hadoop-specific class. 

### Reducer<Text, IntWritable, Text, IntWritable>
Text: This is the type of the input key. In this case, the reducer expects input keys of type Text.

IntWritable: This is the type of the input value. In this case, the reducer expects input values of type IntWritable.

Text: This is the type of the output key. The reducer processes the intermediate key-value pairs generated by the mapper and produces a final set of key-value pairs. In this case, the output keys are of type Text.

IntWritable: This is the type of the output value. The reducer processes the intermediate key-value pairs generated by the mapper and produces a final set of key-value pairs. In this case, the output values are of type IntWritable.
