# Exercise 13: 
## Format input: 
Data in multiple texts. The content of each documents contains only lowercase characters, spaces and newline characters.
## Content: 
Identify average number  of occurences of each unique word in each line this word appears in data.
+ Only identify on lines this word appears
+ Example: "abc" appears 1 time on line 1, 0 time on line 2 and 3 time on line 3 so average number of occurences of this word is (1+3)/2 = 2.
=> (word,average), with **word** is unique word in data and **average** is average number of occurences of this word
